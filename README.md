As a super noob, I do like to understand what is going on and although I run an X1 Validator Node and use BlackBeard's X1 Console for it... I also found the validator.x1.wiki site super handy from Xen Artist.
However when there was a massive outage of Cloudflare.. that got me thinking... maybe I should try to make a tool that does some of those handy tasks and gathering of information locally, just running from my own computer.
That is what this project is about. Trying to create tools/apps that I can run locally on my computer so I do not need to rely 100% on the availability of websites.
